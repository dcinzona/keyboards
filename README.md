Keyboard files for various custom builds (Mammoth75)

## Mammoth75 modified firmware
Sets the knob sensitivity so it doesn't take 50 million full rotations to go from 0-100%
Flips the knob rotation so clockwise is... clockwise, and CCW is CCW.  The firmware posted on the QMK repo has this flipped backwards.
